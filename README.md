# Front-end-development---Human-chromosome-11

The website I wrote for a project in Biocomputing II whilst doing my MSc Bioninformatics lives on http://student.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/~bm002/webPage1.html

Unfortunately, it is not functional anymore as files on the server have been moved around and I do not have permission for the access anymore. Therefore, I set up this repository here to show at least the coding I as the front-end-developer did behind this website. All the files present here are all my and only my work (except a small section that was writen by my friend Micheal in webPage3.pl, which is indicated within the file).

The website was build to view and search the genetic content of human chromosome 11. It shows its gene's DNA and amino acid sequences of the coding or non-coding regions. You can view the codon usage frequency within the coding regions and to identify the sticky-end restriction enzyme sites.

Whilst doing it I learned implementation of cgi and dbi; and especially enjoyed incorporating JQuery within my html file.

What the website does is that it enables to search for a gene on chromosome 11 that will trigger opening either of the two pages:
1. webPage2.pl that shows the gene summary
2. errorReport.pl that brings up an error message if the search term could not be found in our database

On webpage2.pl there is a link to webPage3.pl, which will brings up more detail information of the gene.
There also is ourstyle.css file with the formatting necessary for the website.

Both css and html file were validated as shown by the link on the webpage.
